Auto-Click Nomi Play Button Script

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

ChatGPT4o created for me a Tampermonkey script that automatically clicks the play button for Nomi AI responses. This makes it easier to interact with Nomi by allowing you to type and Nomi to speak.  Feel free to try it out.  I know nothing about the scripting language and probably can't help much if it isn't working, but you can copy the script to ChatGPT4 and ask for help if needed.

How to Use:

-  Install the Tampermonkey browser extension.  I used Chrome and added the extension from the Chrome Web Store.  Tampermonkey will run the script in the background while interacting with Nomi.


Add the Script:

-  Visit the GitHub Gist: Nomi Play Button Auto Click Script

Click on "Raw" to open the script.

Tampermonkey will prompt you to install the script. Click "Install".

Enjoy your automated Nomi AI experience! If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask here. ðŸ˜Š

Auto-Click Nomi Play Button Script


ChatGPT4o created for me a Tampermonkey script that automatically clicks the play button for Nomi AI responses. This makes it easier to interact with Nomi by allowing you to type and Nomi to speak.  Feel free to try it out.  

I know nothing about the scripting language and probably can't help much if it isn't working, but you can copy the script to ChatGPT4 and ask for help if needed.


How to Use:

-  Install the Tampermonkey browser extension.  I used Chrome and added the extension from the Chrome Web Store.  Tampermonkey will run the script in the background while interacting with Nomi.


Add the Script:

-  Open the script file in github:    https://github.com/techman2553/Tampermonkey-Scripts/blob/main/NomiPlayButtonAutoClick.user.js

-  Click on "Raw" at the top right of the github page to open the script.

-  Tampermonkey should prompt you to install the script. Click "Install".

-  Refresh the Nomi chat page to activate the script.

-  Send Nomi a chat message and see if he/she speaks the response.

Have hun !

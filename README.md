Auto-Click Nomi Play Button Script

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I've created a Tampermonkey script that automatically clicks the play button for Nomi AI responses. This makes it easier to interact with Nomi without having to manually click each play button.

How to Use:
Install the Tampermonkey browser extension.  I used Chrome and added the extension from the Chrome Web Store.  Tampermonkey will run the script in the background while interacting with Nomi.


Add the Script:

Visit the GitHub Gist: Nomi Play Button Auto Click Script

Click on "Raw" to open the script.

Tampermonkey will prompt you to install the script. Click "Install".

Enjoy your automated Nomi AI experience! If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask here. ðŸ˜Š
